# Security Policy

## üîí Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
   - Protected routes with middleware
   - Role-based access control (User/Admin)

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Configured CORS to allow specific origins
   - Credentials support enabled
   - Environment-based origin configuration

3. **Input Validation**
   - Basic input validation in controllers
   - Mongoose schema validation
   - File upload restrictions (image formats only)

4. **Database Security**
   - Password field excluded from queries
   - User data sanitization
   - Proper error handling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Recommendations

#### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Create strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
   - [ ] Use environment-specific database URLs
   - [ ] Secure API keys and secrets
   - [ ] Never commit `.env` files to version control

2. **Input Validation Enhancement**
   - [ ] Add comprehensive input validation middleware
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   - [ ] Add request size limits
   - [ ] Sanitize user inputs

3. **Authentication Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement refresh tokens
   - [ ] Add password strength requirements
   - [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - [ ] Add email verification

4. **API Security**
   - [ ] Add request rate limiting
   - [ ] Implement API versioning
   - [ ] Add request logging and monitoring
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling

5. **File Upload Security**
   - [ ] Validate file types and sizes
   - [ ] Scan uploaded files for malware
   - [ ] Implement secure file storage
   - [ ] Add file access controls

### üö® Critical Security Issues to Address

1. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - No `.env` files found
   - Hardcoded localhost URLs in frontend
   - Missing JWT secret configuration

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Previously allowed all origins (`*`)
   - Now configured for specific origins

3. **Error Handling**
   - Some endpoints expose internal errors
   - Need standardized error responses

4. **Input Validation**
   - Limited validation on user inputs
   - No SQL injection protection (though using Mongoose helps)

### üîß Security Checklist

- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure production CORS settings
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation middleware
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure secure headers
- [ ] Implement HTTPS in production
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning

### üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [alexleitanthem0@icloud.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use HTTPS** in production
3. **Regular updates** of dependencies
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Implement backup** and recovery procedures
6. **Regular security audits**
7. **User education** about security practices
